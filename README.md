## Networking Concepts


	..*
	1. Operating Systems
		1. UNIX-based Operating Systems
			1. Linux
			2. Mac/OS
		2. Windows
	2. OSI Model
		1. 7 layers:
			1. hi
			2. hi
			3. hi
			4. hi
			5. hi
			6. hi
			7. hi
	3. Topology Networks
	4. Networks (Subnets / Private and Public networks)
	5. TCP/IP
		1. IPv4 versus IPv6
	6. DHCP
	7. DNS
	8. Switches
	9. Ports
	10. Client-Server (server-based networking)
	11. VPN - a virtual private network, which allows you to create a secure connection to another network over the Internet (use cases include accessing region-restricted websites, and protecting sensitive data)
	12. Security
		1. Attacks and Vulnerabilities
			1. DDos
		2. Firewalls
		3. Public and Private Keys

# Projects

## Hamiltons

	..*
	1. How to flash Hamiltons
		1. Have with you the following materials : batteries, label maker, hamiltons, j-link wire with 3 prongs at the end, double-sided tape
		2. Take out a single Hamilton from the silver bag containing pairs of two Hamiltons
		3. Place the three-pronged end of the j-link into the similar holes on the Hamilton (located on the top right corner of the device, in between 4 holes)
		4. Hold the j-link in place, and press the Enter key on the computer attached
		5. Once the flashing had completed, set the Hamilton down
			- Take care to remember the order in which you place them, in case you decide to flash multiple (maximum of 4) before proceeding to the next step!!!
		6. Type a capitalized "L" on the computer
			- This should trigger the label maker, which should print labels for the Hamiltons, in the order that they were flashed!
		7. Press "Cut" on the labelmaker, once it has finished printing
		8. Cut the labels, but leave a little of the whitespace so the sticker can be peeled.
		9. Stick on the Hamilton such that the QR code is on the side, and the number/letter combination is along the front of the Hamilton. Look at an example for assistance.
		10. Place some double sided tape on a battery
		11. Attach battery to the Hamilton, with the tape facing down
		12. If you see a light flashing from the top of the Hamilton every few seconds, you're good to go!
			- If you don't, do not be concerned, make sure you've placed the battery the correct way, and flashed it properly
		13. Repeat steps 2-12.

wow wow much error, such confusion

You may encounter this error along the way. Try "go get"-ing

You may encounter this error while doing this. Try importing lib-ssl crypto something something.

--* basically what was happening was that you didnt have a library that was being used by bosswave. nice.
